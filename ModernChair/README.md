# MODERN CHAIR PROJECT 

Played around with CSS animations to add some movement and interactivity to the design. For example, when you hover over the chair, the legs and backrest transition smoothly to a darker shade, creating a subtle but eye-catching effect.

Focused on using CSS combinators and animations to create a stylish and dynamic design.
